# FreeBSD ports

Repology primarily uses FreeBSD for development and production.
To simplify deployment, ports of needed compoments are provided.

## Ports

* database/postgresql-libversion - PostgreSQL [extension](https://github.com/repology/postgresql-libversion) with support for version string comparison.
* devel/libversion - [libversion](https://github.com/repology/libversion), advanced version string comparison library. Port is fully functional and may be included into official Ports tree.
* www/repology - [repology](https://github.com/repology/repology) itself. Port is currently not functional and just helps installing needed dependencies.
